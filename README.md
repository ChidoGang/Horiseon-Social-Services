{  Troubleshooting & Changes} 
- The index.Html files uses multiple "Div" Elements. I changed it to to semantic to give it more structure. Html elements in the order of header using "nav" inside of them. Section,aside, and footer.
-I also modified the elements in the index.html, to help structure the code in the same order as my website. 
The Title was modified to properly identify the webpage. it was changed to Horison inc. comments were also added to the html file and css.
